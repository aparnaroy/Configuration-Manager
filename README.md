## Problem

Fraud can occur at any stage of a financial transaction — from user login, to payment authorization, to account updates.
While analysis of such activities are handled by a Decisioning Platform, the platform needs to know where potential fraud signals may originate.

## Task

We worked closely with a senior leader at Capital One to design and develop a centralized tool — a Configuration Manager — that allows users to define and manage data sources (e.g., tables, APIs) used by the Decisioning Platform to orchestrate where and how fraud signals are detected.

## Outcome

Improved automation and orchestration logic in the Decisioning Platform, eliminating the need for hard-coding.
